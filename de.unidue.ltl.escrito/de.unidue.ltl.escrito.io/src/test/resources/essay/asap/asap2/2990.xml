    <essay>A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax.  Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there.  Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship.  Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.       First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted.  If they offend you then do not read them.  It is as simple as that.  Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs.  A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series.  @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs.  Therefore those people boycott the series.     I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released.  While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing.  Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party.  They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong.  I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book!       Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content.  For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person.  Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards.     Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true.  If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library.  Although there could be a way to compromise.  If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides.       In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children.  When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read.  While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read.  Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes.  Books are a gateway to another world.  Why take that magic away from children</essay>
