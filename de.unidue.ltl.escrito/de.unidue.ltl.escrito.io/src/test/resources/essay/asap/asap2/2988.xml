    <essay>Have you seen a magazine, book, movies, etc., that are found affensive? What experiences did you have? Here is my opinion on if I think that those books should be removed or not.       I have noticed that some movies are affensive to other people. Like for an example, the @CAPS1 movies, books is about @CAPS2 and some people don't believe in them or they don't like the movie so I do kind of see no point of making a movie that is about someone that is not real. However, some movies are okay for some people and their age. The movies that are rated '@CAPS3' are for the people who shouldn't be watching it yet like kids under the age.      Magazines though do have some type of thing that I think that is affensive to other people. Like, I don't remember the name of them but they would have sections that would talk bad about another person like one of the kids would talk about the president or something like that. So I think some magazines should be removed off the shelves.      The books however, I don't see a reason why to have them removed off the shelves. I don't think the books seem to be affensive as much as graphical. There could be some books out there that might be affensive to people though, like the ones that talk about a family that has no money or talk bad about them. For an example, you would be able to find a book and read it and find out that it is talking bout things that you don't want to know yet or want to know.      So as you can see I have made an opinion on what they should do either keep the books, magazines, or movies off the shelf. But then I do see it the other way to. Some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting</essay>
