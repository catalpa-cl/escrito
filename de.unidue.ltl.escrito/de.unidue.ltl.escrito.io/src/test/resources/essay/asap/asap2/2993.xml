    <essay>Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are, and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read? I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves.     Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays. If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it.     Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man. Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action. Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face. Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her. Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living. Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting. @CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life.     Just think all that I have told you about, gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people. these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves.</essay>
