    <essay>A lot of @CAPS3 today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and Magazines. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and my views on the censorship of @CAPS3. Here's my idea to fix the problem.      I understand that books and other material @MONTH1 offend certain people, but it might not offend others. Thats why I think @CAPS3 should have a room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be seperate rooms for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content.      This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain @CAPS1 to enter the 'bad content' room. I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 could be @NUM1 years of @CAPS1 to enter the room. That seems fair enough. Your old enough to be able to handle the content.      I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not.      Seperate rooms, @CAPS1 limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very affective. I hope to start seeing that in the future</essay>
