    <essay>Do you think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines shout be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive? Such as magazines, books, movies, and even music. I simply do not find any of it right that few peoples opinion's should matter depending on what they find offensive for two reasons. Those reasons being that you picked it out yourself and that you have traveled to the library looking for something you will enjoy.     The first reason I think that certain books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed form the shelves are because people have picked them out there selves. Noone is ever going to pick up a book or magazine or even watch movies and listen to music that looks, seems, or even sounds offensive. Mainly because alot of people don't take being ofeneded to kindly. For example, why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing to them?     The second reason that I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves are because if your going to the library your looking for an interesting book, type of music, a movie, or a magazine. Most likely you're going to end up getting one that looks intersting to you and something that you feel fits your taste. So if there is a book, some sort of music, a movie, or a magazine and it looks offensive then don't get it because if somethings going to offend you its going to be pretty obvious due to what it looks like, seems like, or even sounds like.     In my opinion I think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to some people that they should not be taken off the shelf. If you picked something out at the library or went to the library looking for something that you would enjoy, you will obviously end up knowing if something looks, seems, or even sounds offensive</essay>
