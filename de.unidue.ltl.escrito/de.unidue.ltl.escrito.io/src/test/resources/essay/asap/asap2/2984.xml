    <essay>How @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library? I, along with many other students, @CAPS4 find this discouraging and distastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population @MONTH1 be born.     Like the beloved @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I @CAPS4 not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now. All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like @PERSON2 did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity @CAPS4 not only affect this generation, but the futures of all.          If this censorhip was to be allowed, who is to say what all  could be censored? Who @CAPS4 be the final judge as to what books @CAPS4 be banned? It @CAPS4 all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. This struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties. Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe @CAPS4  be wrong. For instance, it @CAPS4 be like an @CAPS1 forcing a @CAPS2 to not believe in @CAPS3; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship @CAPS4 lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing.     Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books @CAPS4 be to censor all individual mentality. Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world @CAPS4 become similiarly vapid and dull. Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality @CAPS4 decrease.     To conclude, censorship @CAPS4 be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. So how @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? Disrespected? That is how I @CAPS4 feel</essay>
