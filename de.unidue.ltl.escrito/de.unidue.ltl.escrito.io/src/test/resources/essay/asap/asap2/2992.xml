    <essay>When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves, because their the ones thats going to the library anyway.                 I believe that everybody is intitle to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed.  For example, some music could be offensive; therefore, I'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries. I'm saying the offensive music should be removed</essay>
