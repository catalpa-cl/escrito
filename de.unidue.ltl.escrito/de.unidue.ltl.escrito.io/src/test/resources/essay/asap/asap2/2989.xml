    <essay>Personally I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned. If they are found offensive to the public. I think it offends lots of people. Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inaproppriate material. I think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eight-teen years of age. The economy is bad enough the way it is. There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they should't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines.      I think music is what influences a person the most. If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a persons mind. I know this from experience. I also believe that movies influence a peron lot too. For example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it. Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' That is just one example of how the humans mind can change.     In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though. Also, I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library. So that  just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending</essay>
