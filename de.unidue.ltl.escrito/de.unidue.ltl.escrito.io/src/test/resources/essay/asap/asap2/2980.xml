    <essay>Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves? People have different oppions, of whats good and whats bad. I have read and seen a lot of books in my life time. I hear people telling me, 'oh dont read that book its a bad book.'But I ask myself, @CAPS2 do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance?'      @CAPS1 are some books, music, movies, and magazines out @CAPS1 that are offensive. Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books, from the libraries we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think its offensive?     Ask yourself the question again, '@CAPS2 do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance?' @CAPS3't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own oppion is</essay>
