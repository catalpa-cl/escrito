    <essay>Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.      So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. We I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated.     The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will  always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go.      I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years.     So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer.     Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood.     The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to.     Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.      So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay</essay>
